Bonanza is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers and does not transfer legal ownership of items from the sellers to buyers.

In the event a dispute arises between you and Bonanza, please email Bonanza at [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https:\/\/www.bonanza.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection) and we will work quickly towards a solution.

Choice of Law and Forum.** Etsy is based in New York, so if there are claims between you and Etsy that aren\u2019t subject to arbitration, you and Etsy each agree to litigate those claims exclusively in state or federal court in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. The exception is if you file in small claims court\u00a0\u2013 you can do that in the county of your residence. Except as prohibited by law, these Terms shall be governed exclusively by New York law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and U.S. federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act). However, if you are based in Canada, you may instead bring any non-arbitrable claims in the courts and under the laws (including federal law) of either Quebec (if you are an individual or sole proprietor in Quebec), or Ontario. For clarity, this Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out of arbitration under Section 11.G.\n\n12\\.

If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201cNAM) ([https:\/\/www.namadr.com\/](https:\/\/www.namadr.com\/)). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum\u2019s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nd. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
